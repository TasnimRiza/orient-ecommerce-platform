---

```

To run tests across the entire project:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Production Deployment on Render

This repository includes a production Blueprint in `render.yaml`. It provisions:

- A Django web service in Render's Singapore region
- A private managed PostgreSQL database
- A persistent 1 GB disk for product/category image uploads
- Automatic HTTPS, static-file collection, migrations, health checks, and deploys from `main`
- One-time catalog, coupon, and branch seeding

### Deploy

1. Commit these files and push the repository to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare production deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Sign in to [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/), select **New > Blueprint**, and connect this repository.
3. Keep the detected `render.yaml` path and select **Apply**.
4. When prompted for `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, enter a unique, strong password. Render generates `SECRET_KEY` and the PostgreSQL credentials automatically.
5. Wait for the database and web service to report **Live**, then open its generated `.onrender.com` address.

Production administration is available at `/django-admin/` and the custom back office is at `/admin-panel/`. Sign in as `admin` with the password entered during Blueprint creation.

### Custom domain

After adding a domain in Render, add these environment variables to the web service and redeploy:

```env
ALLOWED_HOSTS=shop.example.com,www.shop.example.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://shop.example.com,https://www.shop.example.com
```

### Important cost note

The Blueprint intentionally uses paid persistent resources because an e-commerce database and uploaded product images must survive restarts and redeployments. Removing the disk or changing the database to a temporary/free plan can cause uploaded files or database data to expire.
